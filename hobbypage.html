            <p>Eduard Wiiralt (20 March 1898 – 8 January 1954) was a well-known <a id="link"
                    href="https://www.visitestonia.com/en/">Estonian</a> graphic
                artist. In art history,
                Wiiralt
                is considered as the most remarkable master of Estonian graphic art in the first half of his century.
            </p>

            <p>Eduard Wiiralt was born in Kalitino Manor, Tsarskoselsky Uyezd, Saint Petersburg Governorate to Estonian
                estate
                servants Anton and Sophie-Elisabeth Wiiralt. In 1909, the family moved to Estonia, where the father was
                employed
                in the Varangu estate in the Järva County. At age of 17, Wiiralt entered the Tallinn School of Applied
                Art.
                There one of his teachers was the Estonian painter and draughtsman, Nikolai Triik, who exerted strong
                influence
                on the work of the young artist. Wiiralt did not graduate, however, due to the start of the German
                occupation
                and revolution.</p>

            <p>Wiiralt continued his studies in Tartu in the Pallas art school, working in the sculpture studio of Anton
                Starkopf in 1919. There the teachings in the art of engraving were guided by the manuals and the works
                of
                the
                old masters. This influenced his artistic technique even to his later years. The studies were
                interrupted by
                his
                participation in the Estonian War of Independence. In 1922–1923, Wiiralt continued his studies as a
                grantee
                of
                Pallas, in the Dresden Academy of Art in Germany; under the supervision of Professor Selmar Werner. In
                his
                works
                of that period a certain influence of German expressionism may be observed. Wiiralt returned to Tartu in
                the
                fall of 1923. In 1924 he graduated from Graphic Arts Department of art school Pallas leading its graphic
                studio
                during following year.</p>

            <p>He went to Paris in 1925 and lived there almost without interruption until 1938. In Paris he created his
                etching
                Hell. In 1937 the International Graphic Exhibition in Vienna recognized him as the leading engraver in
                Europe,
                honoring him with its gold medal. From July 1938
                to February 1939 he lived and worked in Marrakesh Morocco, returning the following year to his homeland
                Estonia.
            </p>

            <p class="p-last">He survived World War II in Estonia. In 1944, he made an attempt to return to Paris, but
                the
                war took him
                instead to Germany and later to Sweden. It was not until the fall of 1946 that he reached Paris again.
                At
                the end, he lived in the southern part of the city, Sceaux, at Rue Houdan 61. Eduard Wiiralt died at the
                age
                of 55 in Paris, in the Danncourt hospital due to gastric cancer and was buried in the Père Lachaise
                Cemetery
                on 12 January 1954.</p>
